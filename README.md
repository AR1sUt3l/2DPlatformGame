### Purpose
Due to my interest in wanting to develop a game, I decided to start with a 2D platformer as I think it will be fun to do

### Basic Requirements
* It will have a base character that can move across the map
* It will have a map that will be have some obstacles
* When the character comes across an obstacle it needs to not be able to move through it
